# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 08, 2018
##### (Udacity's Project)

**Today's Progress:** I wrote my first test code and finally started #100DaysOfCode! 

**Thoughts:** I've been taking some lessons in Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree to get a better understanding of how Tests work and today I felt a bit prepared to sit and work on the first scenario described in the Project's Rubric. It wasn't that easy and I'm still not sure of what I'm doing, but no red screen. So, yay! And in this beautiful Friday I start my #100DaysOfCode. There's no better day than today. ;)

### Day 4: June 12, 2018
##### (Udacity's Project and Exercise)

**Today's Progress:** Start the Project 6 of Udacity's FEND >> Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1 (work 1) and a Cat Clicker for an exercise (work 2)

**Thoughts:** I had to delete mw whole directory of P6 becaude of a long story about API's and lack of attention (my fault :/). Besides that part, my day was pretty good.

### Day 5: June 13, 2018
##### (Udacity's Exercise)

**Today's Progress:** I've reached a new requirement of Cat Clicker that gave me an opportunity to research and study more about Closure and IIFE.

**Thoughts:** Cat Clicker has been more difficult than I thought.

### Day 6: June 14, 2018
##### (Udacity's Exercise)

**Today's Progress:** Cat Clicker is done!

**Thoughts:** No regrets on doing this exercise. Each day I value more these carefree type of exercises. Or even projects where the goal is just to learn or practice something that you've heard or read.
