# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 08, 2018
##### (Udacity's Project)

**Today's Progress:** I wrote my first test code and finally started #100DaysOfCode! 

**Thoughts:** I've been taking some lessons in Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree to get a better understanding of how Tests work and today I felt a bit prepared to sit and work on the first scenario described in the Project's Rubric. It wasn't that easy and I'm still not sure of what I'm doing, but no red screen. So, yay! And in this beautiful Friday I start my #100DaysOfCode. There's no better day than today. ;)
